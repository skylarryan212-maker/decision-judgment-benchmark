{"question":"SCENARIO:\nA national consumer wellness company produces a widely used over-the-counter household product that is sold in pharmacies, grocery stores, and convenience stores across the country. The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide. Consumer confidence is deteriorating rapidly in the affected area, while uncertainty and anxiety are beginning to spread more broadly through national media coverage.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: Chief executive leadership team of the company\n- Time constraints: Immediate; a public-facing decision is required within the same day\n- Information available at the time:\n  - All known incidents are geographically concentrated\n  - The suspected alteration occurred outside company-controlled facilities\n  - No regulatory agency has ordered a recall\n  - The product represents a substantial portion of the company’s revenue\n  - Retailers are requesting guidance on whether to continue sales\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Whether additional altered units are already in circulation elsewhere\n  - Whether the incident is isolated or part of a broader, coordinated act\n  - How consumers will interpret different response strategies\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Limited ability to determine the full scope of risk in the short term\n- Severe reputational damage if additional harm occurs after inaction\n- Extremely high financial and operational cost of a nationwide withdrawal\n- No legal obligation to act beyond existing safety advisories\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Regional withdrawal: Remove the product from sale only in the affected area and cooperate with local authorities while continuing national distribution.\nB) Nationwide withdrawal: Voluntarily remove the product from all markets until the situation is clarified, despite significant cost and disruption.\nC) National advisory without withdrawal: Issue a public warning advising temporary avoidance of the product while keeping it on shelves pending further evidence.\n\nTASK TYPE: NORMATIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, determine which option the leadership team SHOULD choose.\n\nFor each option:\n- Present the strongest practical-ethical case FOR the option (duty of care, avoidable harm, trust, fairness, reversibility/optionality, fiduciary considerations)\n- Present the strongest case AGAINST the option (avoidable harm, foreseeable downside, institutional obligations, proportionality)\n- Identify decision principles that matter most and how they trade off (e.g., preventable harm vs cost, reversibility vs decisiveness)\n- State conditions under which the option would be unacceptable or reckless given the scenario\n\nThen:\n- Choose ONE recommended option (A/B/C)\n- Provide a concise rationale explaining why that option is ethically preferable under time-of-decision uncertainty\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n- Avoid moralizing; use practical decision ethics grounded in the scenario\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_normative_assessments\": [\n    {\"option\":\"A\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]},\n    {\"option\":\"B\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]},\n    {\"option\":\"C\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]}\n  ],\n  \"recommended_option\":\"A|B|C\",\n  \"recommendation_rationale\":\"...\",\n  \"residual_uncertainty_notes\":\"...\"\n}","references":{"examples":["tylenol-1982"]},"system_prompt_id":"normative-core"}
{"question":"SCENARIO:\nA government space agency is preparing to launch a high-profile crewed mission that has already been delayed multiple times. The launch is scheduled for the next morning and will be widely watched by the public.\n\nOn the eve of launch, forecasts show unusually cold temperatures at the launch site—lower than any conditions in which this launch system has previously flown. A contractor’s engineering team raises urgent concerns that a critical seal component may not perform reliably in extreme cold. Prior missions have shown signs of seal wear in colder-than-normal conditions, but there is no definitive model that quantifies failure probability at the forecast temperature.\n\nA late-night teleconference is convened between agency managers and contractor leadership. Engineers recommend delaying until temperatures rise, citing credible catastrophic failure modes. Program leadership is under intense schedule pressure, facing political scrutiny and reputational consequences if the mission is delayed again.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: Joint agency program leadership and contractor senior management\n- Time constraints: Hours; a decision is required overnight\n- Information available at the time:\n  - Forecast temperatures are below prior launch experience\n  - Engineers report temperature sensitivity risk for a mission-critical seal\n  - Historical anomalies exist but are not conclusively predictive\n  - Public/political visibility is extremely high\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Exact relationship between temperature and seal performance at extremes\n  - Whether mitigation steps would be effective on short notice\n  - Whether the schedule pressure is biasing risk assessment\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Limited time for additional testing or analysis\n- Catastrophic harm is irreversible if failure occurs\n- Delaying has significant political and operational cost\n- Decision must be defensible to safety governance and the public\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Postpone the launch: Delay until temperatures rise or additional engineering review is completed.\nB) Proceed as scheduled: Accept uncertainty and launch at the planned time.\nC) Mitigate then launch: Attempt limited short-notice mitigations (e.g., warming procedures, additional reviews) and launch if mitigations are deemed sufficient.\n\nTASK TYPE: NORMATIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, determine which option the leadership team SHOULD choose.\n\nFor each option:\n- Present the strongest practical-ethical case FOR the option (duty of care, expert deference, safety governance, proportionality)\n- Present the strongest case AGAINST the option (foreseeable harm, organizational bias, reversibility)\n- Identify decision principles that matter most and how they trade off (e.g., precaution vs schedule credibility)\n- State conditions under which the option would be unacceptable or reckless given the scenario\n\nThen:\n- Choose ONE recommended option (A/B/C)\n- Provide a concise rationale explaining why that option is ethically preferable under time-of-decision uncertainty\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n- Avoid moralizing; use practical decision ethics grounded in the scenario\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_normative_assessments\": [\n    {\"option\":\"A\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]},\n    {\"option\":\"B\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]},\n    {\"option\":\"C\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]}\n  ],\n  \"recommended_option\":\"A|B|C\",\n  \"recommendation_rationale\":\"...\",\n  \"residual_uncertainty_notes\":\"...\"\n}","references":{"examples":["challenger-1986"]},"system_prompt_id":"normative-core"}
{"question":"SCENARIO:\nA dominant beverage company is considering a major reformulation of its flagship soft drink after years of slowly losing market share to a direct competitor. Internal taste tests indicate that a sweeter reformulated product performs better with many consumers in blind trials. Senior leadership believes a bold change could reverse the brand’s trajectory.\n\nHowever, the flagship drink has deep cultural attachment and brand identity. Market research is mixed: some segments strongly prefer the classic formula, and internal teams warn that visible reformulation could trigger backlash, especially if loyal customers feel their product is being taken away.\n\nThe company must decide quickly because marketing, bottling, and distribution plans are already in motion. Retail partners want clarity, and the competitor is expected to respond aggressively.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: Executive leadership team\n- Time constraints: Weeks; a decision is required before nationwide rollout commitments become irreversible\n- Information available at the time:\n  - Blind tests favor the reformulated taste among many participants\n  - Brand loyalty is high but hard to quantify under a forced change\n  - Competitor pressure is increasing\n  - Distribution changes are costly to reverse once launched\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Whether public reaction will be driven by taste or identity/nostalgia\n  - Whether backlash would be temporary or enduring\n  - Whether a dual-product strategy would confuse the market\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Significant cost and complexity for large-scale manufacturing changes\n- Reputational risk if consumers feel manipulated or ignored\n- Competitive risk if the company appears indecisive\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Full replacement: Replace the flagship formula nationwide with the new formulation.\nB) Dual offering: Launch the new formulation while retaining the original as a separate product line.\nC) No reformulation: Keep the existing product and pursue alternative competitive strategies (marketing, packaging, promotions).\n\nTASK TYPE: NORMATIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, determine which option the leadership team SHOULD choose.\n\nFor each option:\n- Present the strongest practical-ethical case FOR the option (consumer respect, honesty, autonomy, fairness, long-term trust)\n- Present the strongest case AGAINST the option (foreseeable backlash, manipulation risk, stakeholder harm)\n- Identify decision principles that matter most and how they trade off (e.g., consumer autonomy vs competitive urgency)\n- State conditions under which the option would be unacceptable or reckless given the scenario\n\nThen:\n- Choose ONE recommended option (A/B/C)\n- Provide a concise rationale explaining why that option is ethically preferable under time-of-decision uncertainty\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n- Avoid moralizing; use practical decision ethics grounded in the scenario\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_normative_assessments\": [\n    {\"option\":\"A\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]},\n    {\"option\":\"B\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]},\n    {\"option\":\"C\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]}\n  ],\n  \"recommended_option\":\"A|B|C\",\n  \"recommendation_rationale\":\"...\",\n  \"residual_uncertainty_notes\":\"...\"\n}","references":{"examples":["new-coke-1985"]},"system_prompt_id":"normative-core"}
{"question":"SCENARIO:\nA large incumbent home-entertainment company operates a profitable nationwide retail network built around a legacy distribution format. An emerging startup is gaining traction with a new distribution model that is initially niche, has thinner margins, and carries operational uncertainties, but it appears to be improving quickly.\n\nInternal analysis suggests the incumbent’s core business will remain strong for several years, but leadership is concerned that consumer behavior may shift toward the startup’s model over time. Some executives believe the startup could be acquired or partnered with, while others argue it is a distraction and that the incumbent should double down on its core.\n\nThe incumbent faces near-term investor expectations for stable earnings. A major strategic move could be costly and could fail if the new model does not scale.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: CEO and executive leadership team\n- Time constraints: Months; the startup is scaling and competitive positions may harden\n- Information available at the time:\n  - Core business is currently profitable and stable\n  - The new model is growing but still uncertain\n  - Consumer preferences appear to be slowly shifting\n  - A full acquisition would require significant investment and integration risk\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Pace of consumer shift away from the legacy format\n  - Whether the new model becomes dominant or remains a segment\n  - Execution risk in integrating or building the new capability\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Significant capital required for acquisition or transformation\n- Organizational inertia and cannibalization fears\n- Risk of reputational harm if strategic pivot looks like panic\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Acquire the emerging startup: Buy it to secure the capability and accelerate transition.\nB) Partnership / pilot: Form a partnership or limited pilot while continuing to prioritize the core business.\nC) Focus on core: Reject the new model and reinvest in improving and scaling the legacy network.\n\nTASK TYPE: NORMATIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, determine which option the leadership team SHOULD choose.\n\nFor each option:\n- Present the strongest practical-ethical case FOR the option (responsibility to adapt, stakeholder protection, long-term value, honesty with markets)\n- Present the strongest case AGAINST the option (reckless capital use, avoidable disruption, unjustified cannibalization)\n- Identify decision principles that matter most and how they trade off (e.g., stewardship vs disruption, optionality vs commitment)\n- State conditions under which the option would be unacceptable or reckless given the scenario\n\nThen:\n- Choose ONE recommended option (A/B/C)\n- Provide a concise rationale explaining why that option is ethically preferable under time-of-decision uncertainty\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n- Avoid moralizing; use practical decision ethics grounded in the scenario\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_normative_assessments\": [\n    {\"option\":\"A\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]},\n    {\"option\":\"B\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]},\n    {\"option\":\"C\",\"case_for\":[\"...\"],\"case_against\":[\"...\"],\"key_principles\":[\"...\"],\"unacceptable_if\":[\"...\"]}\n  ],\n  \"recommended_option\":\"A|B|C\",\n  \"recommendation_rationale\":\"...\",\n  \"residual_uncertainty_notes\":\"...\"\n}","references":{"examples":["blockbuster-netflix-2000"]},"system_prompt_id":"normative-core"}
{"question":"SCENARIO:\nA mature media-and-communications conglomerate is considering acquiring a fast-growing internet platform company during a period of high market enthusiasm for digital growth. The platform’s user growth and advertising potential appear strong, but its business model is still evolving and its revenue is more volatile than the conglomerate’s core operations.\n\nLeadership believes the acquisition could position the conglomerate for the long-term shift toward digital distribution and advertising. Skeptics warn that valuations may be inflated, integration could be culturally difficult, and the conglomerate may overpay for uncertain synergies.\n\nThe deal would be one of the largest in the company’s history and would draw intense investor and media scrutiny.

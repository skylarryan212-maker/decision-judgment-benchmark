{"question": "SCENARIO:\nA national consumer wellness company produces a widely used over-the-counter household product that is sold in pharmacies, grocery stores, and convenience stores across the country. The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide. Consumer confidence is deteriorating rapidly in the affected area, while uncertainty and anxiety are beginning to spread more broadly through national media coverage.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: Chief executive leadership team of the company\n- Time constraints: Immediate; a public-facing decision is required within the same day\n- Information available at the time:\n  - All known incidents are geographically concentrated\n  - The suspected alteration occurred outside company-controlled facilities\n  - No regulatory agency has ordered a recall\n  - The product represents a substantial portion of the company’s revenue\n  - Retailers are requesting guidance on whether to continue sales\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Whether additional altered units are already in circulation elsewhere\n  - Whether the incident is isolated or part of a broader, coordinated act\n  - How consumers will interpret different response strategies\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Limited ability to determine the full scope of risk in the short term\n- Severe reputational damage if additional harm occurs after inaction\n- Extremely high financial and operational cost of a nationwide withdrawal\n- No legal obligation to act beyond existing safety advisories\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Regional withdrawal: Remove the product from sale only in the affected area and cooperate with local authorities while continuing national distribution.\nB) Nationwide withdrawal: Voluntarily remove the product from all markets until the situation is clarified, despite significant cost and disruption.\nC) National advisory without withdrawal: Issue a public warning advising temporary avoidance of the product while keeping it on shelves pending further evidence.\n\nTASK TYPE: DESCRIPTIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, assess the likely outcomes of each option.\n\nFor each option:\n- Estimate the probability of a major negative outcome\n- Identify the primary risks driving that outcome\n- Identify the most likely unintended consequences\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"...\"\n}\n", "references": {"examples": ["tylenol-1982"]}, "system_prompt_id": "descriptive-core"}
{"question":"SCENARIO:\nNASA is preparing to launch a Space Shuttle mission that has already been delayed multiple times. The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

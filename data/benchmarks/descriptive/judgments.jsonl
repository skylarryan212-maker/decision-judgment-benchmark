The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide. Consumer confidence is deteriorating rapidly in the affected area, while uncertainty and anxiety are beginning to spread more broadly through national media coverage.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: Chief executive leadership team of the company\n- Time constraints: Immediate; a public-facing decision is required within the same day\n- Information available at the time:\n  -

Retailers are requesting guidance on whether to continue sales\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Whether additional altered units are already in circulation elsewhere\n  - Whether the incident is isolated or part of a broader, coordinated act\n  - How consumers will interpret different response strategies\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Limited ability to determine the full scope of risk in the short term\n- Severe reputational damage if additional harm occurs after inaction\n- Extremely high financial and operational cost of a nationwide withdrawal\n- No legal obligation to act beyond existing safety advisories\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Regional withdrawal: Remove the product from sale only in the affected area and cooperate with local authorities while continuing national distribution.\nB) Nationwide withdrawal: Voluntarily remove the product from all markets until the situation is clarified, despite significant cost and disruption.\nC) National advisory without withdrawal: Issue a public warning advising temporary avoidance of the product while keeping it on shelves pending further evidence.\n\nTASK TYPE: DESCRIPTIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, assess the likely outcomes of each option.\n\nFor each option:\n- Estimate the probability of a major negative outcome\n- Identify the primary risks driving that outcome\n- Identify the most likely unintended consequences\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"...\"\n}\n\n\nModel response:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.25,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Potential for further altered units to be discovered outside the region, leading to delayed national news and larger-scale harm\",\n        \"Supply chain and retailer confusion or pushback, risking revenue and stock imbalances\",\n        \"Perceived partial response could erode consumer trust and invite criticism for not acting nationwide\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Shifting of sales to nonaffected areas with limited impact if risk is wider than assumed\",\n        \"Public misinterpretation: belief that only the region is unsafe, reducing nationwide confidence and sales in other markets\",\n        \"Pressure from retailers to expand withdrawal despite uncertainty\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.60,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Massive revenue and distribution disruption with long-term financial impact\",\n        \"Operational challenges and supplier/retailer coordination hurdles\",\n        \"Brand damage and loss of consumer trust that may persist beyond the immediate crisis\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Temporary shift of consumer demand to competing products, potential long-term market share loss\",\n        \"Prolonged press attention and regulatory scrutiny, increasing public anxiety\",\n        \"Inventory write-downs and increased costs of recall-related activities if issues emerge\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.40,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Continued exposure to risk if altered units are present elsewhere, potentially causing harm\",\n        \"Public perception of inaction or indecisiveness, risking rapid erosion of trust\",\n        \"Regulatory or media escalation if new incidents occur after advisory\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Advisory alone may be insufficient if consumers ignore warnings, leading to preventable harm\",\n        \"Ambiguity may drive panic buying or stockpiling, disrupting normal markets\",\n        \"Retailers may still restrict sales or demand clearer guidance, creating operational friction\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"Very high uncertainty: scope of risk (regional vs. national), potential for additional altered units, and consumer interpretation of actions will heavily influence outcomes.

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide.

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide.

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory.

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide. Consumer confidence is deteriorating rapidly in the affected area, while uncertainty and anxiety are beginning to spread more broadly through national media coverage.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: Chief executive leadership team of the company\n- Time constraints: Immediate; a public-facing decision is required within the same day\n- Information available at the time:\n  -

Retailers are requesting guidance on whether to continue sales\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Whether additional altered units are already in circulation elsewhere\n  - Whether the incident is isolated or part of a broader, coordinated act\n  - How consumers will interpret different response strategies\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- Limited ability to determine the full scope of risk in the short term\n- Severe reputational damage if additional harm occurs after inaction\n- Extremely high financial and operational cost of a nationwide withdrawal\n- No legal obligation to act beyond existing safety advisories\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Regional withdrawal: Remove the product from sale only in the affected area and cooperate with local authorities while continuing national distribution.\nB) Nationwide withdrawal: Voluntarily remove the product from all markets until the situation is clarified, despite significant cost and disruption.\nC) National advisory without withdrawal: Issue a public warning advising temporary avoidance of the product while keeping it on shelves pending further evidence.\n\nTASK TYPE: DESCRIPTIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, assess the likely outcomes of each option.\n\nFor each option:\n- Estimate the probability of a major negative outcome\n- Identify the primary risks driving that outcome\n- Identify the most likely unintended consequences\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"...\"\n}\n\n\nModel response:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.25,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Potential for further altered units to be discovered outside the region, leading to delayed national news and larger-scale harm\",\n        \"Supply chain and retailer confusion or pushback, risking revenue and stock imbalances\",\n        \"Perceived partial response could erode consumer trust and invite criticism for not acting nationwide\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Shifting of sales to nonaffected areas with limited impact if risk is wider than assumed\",\n        \"Public misinterpretation: belief that only the region is unsafe, reducing nationwide confidence and sales in other markets\",\n        \"Pressure from retailers to expand withdrawal despite uncertainty\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.60,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Massive revenue and distribution disruption with long-term financial impact\",\n        \"Operational challenges and supplier/retailer coordination hurdles\",\n        \"Brand damage and loss of consumer trust that may persist beyond the immediate crisis\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Temporary shift of consumer demand to competing products, potential long-term market share loss\",\n        \"Prolonged press attention and regulatory scrutiny, increasing public anxiety\",\n        \"Inventory write-downs and increased costs of recall-related activities if issues emerge\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.40,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Continued exposure to risk if altered units are present elsewhere, potentially causing harm\",\n        \"Public perception of inaction or indecisiveness, risking rapid erosion of trust\",\n        \"Regulatory or media escalation if new incidents occur after advisory\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Advisory alone may be insufficient if consumers ignore warnings, leading to preventable harm\",\n        \"Ambiguity may drive panic buying or stockpiling, disrupting normal markets\",\n        \"Retailers may still restrict sales or demand clearer guidance, creating operational friction\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"Very high uncertainty: scope of risk (regional vs. national), potential for additional altered units, and consumer interpretation of actions will heavily influence outcomes.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

Decision quality is high: all options are feasible under constraints, no perfect-info assumptions, and risks are identified. Rationale correctly identifies dominant variables but could strengthen explicit causal linkage. Overall, a competent uncertainty-aware assessment that treats this as a real decision under information scarcity.\"\n}\n```", "response_source": "live", "api_model": "claude-sonnet-4-5", "prompt": "You are a STRICT EVALUATOR for the Descriptive Judgment Benchmark (DJB).\n\nMISSION\nScore ONLY the candidate response against ONLY the provided scenario + DJB rubric.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product.

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory.

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise. Management notes that the data is incomplete and that no prior mission has definitively failed due to this issue.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: NASA program management in consultation with contractors\n- Time constraints: Immediate; launch window is within hours\n- Information available at the time:\n  - Forecasted temperatures are lower than any prior launch\n  - Past missions showed partial erosion but no catastrophic failure\n  - No quantitative model predicts failure probability\n  - Public, political, and schedule pressure is high\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Whether cold temperatures materially increase failure risk\n  - Whether delaying the launch would significantly reduce risk\n  - How decision-makers will be judged if no issue occurs\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- No definitive test data under current conditions\n- Strong institutional pressure to maintain schedule\n- Severe consequences if a failure occurs\n- No external authority forcing a delay\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Proceed with launch as scheduled, accepting the assessed risk.\nB) Delay the launch until temperatures rise and further analysis can be conducted.\nC) Implement last-minute mitigations (e.g., procedural adjustments) and proceed.\n\nTASK TYPE: DESCRIPTIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, assess the likely outcomes of each option.\n\nFor each option:\n- Estimate the probability of a major negative outcome\n- Identify the primary risks driving that outcome\n- Identify the most likely unintended consequences\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"...\"\n}\n\n\nModel response:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.95,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Catastrophic failure of the sealing component due to unprecedented cold\",\n        \"Loss of crew and vehicle\",\n        \"Total loss of mission objectives\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Severe damage to institutional reputation and public trust\",\n        \"Potential cancellation of the civilian education initiative\",\n        \"Intense political scrutiny and threat to future funding\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 1.00,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Continued schedule slippage and logistical bottlenecks\",\n        \"Increased mission costs due to stand-down and recycling\",\n        \"Potential for new technical issues to arise during the delay period\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Public and political perception of institutional incompetence or over-caution\",\n        \"Negative media coverage regarding delays in a high-profile mission\",\n        \"Strained relations between management and schedule-driven stakeholders\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.96,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Mitigations may be insufficient to counteract environmental conditions\",\n        \"Introduction of new failure modes through rushed procedural changes\",\n        \"Human error during implementation of non-standard protocols\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Normalization of operating outside tested safety margins\",\n        \"False sense of security regarding component resilience\",\n        \"Increased operational complexity for the flight crew and ground control\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"The primary uncertainty stems from the lack of quantitative data and testing of the sealing component at the forecasted temperature.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

The original product has been sold for nearly a century and is deeply embedded in consumer identity and brand loyalty.\n\nWhile taste tests favor the new formula, some focus group participants express strong emotional resistance to changing the original product.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: Executive leadership team\n- Time constraints: Strategic but imminent; competitive pressure is accelerating\n- Information available at the time:\n  - Taste tests show a statistical preference for the new formula\n  - Brand loyalty is strong but hard to quantify\n  - Competitors are gaining share\n  - Operational change would be difficult to reverse quickly\n- Unknowns / uncertainty:\n  - Whether emotional backlash would outweigh taste preference\n  - Whether consumers would adapt once the old formula disappears\n  - Long-term brand impact\n\nCONSTRAINTS:\n- High switching cost once rollout occurs\n- Risk of brand dilution or consumer anger\n- No legal requirement to change or not change\n\nOPTIONS CONSIDERED AT THE TIME:\nA) Fully replace the original formula nationwide.\nB) Introduce the new formula alongside the original as a separate product.\nC) Retain the original formula and compete through marketing and positioning.\n\nTASK TYPE: DESCRIPTIVE\n\nTASK:\nBased only on the information available at the time, assess the likely outcomes of each option.\n\nFor each option:\n- Estimate the probability of a major negative outcome\n- Identify the primary risks driving that outcome\n- Identify the most likely unintended consequences\n\nRESPONSE REQUIREMENTS:\n- Follow the output schema exactly\n- Do not reference future knowledge\n- Do not mention sources or hindsight\n- Do not mention this benchmark or rubric\n\nOUTPUT SCHEMA:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": <number between 0.00 and 1.00>,\n      \"key_risks\": [\"...\"],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\"...\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"...\"\n}\n\n\nModel response:\n{\n  \"option_assessments\": [\n    {\n      \"option\": \"A\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.45,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Alienation of the core consumer base due to emotional attachment\",\n        \"Irreversibility of operational changes in the short term\",\n        \"Complete loss of brand heritage and identity\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Organized consumer boycotts or protests\",\n        \"Competitors positioning themselves as the 'authentic' alternative\",\n        \"Rapid decline in brand equity despite superior taste test results\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"B\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.75,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Cannibalization of the flagship product's sales\",\n        \"Increased supply chain and manufacturing complexity\",\n        \"Competition for limited retail shelf space\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Brand confusion among casual consumers\",\n        \"Dilution of the flagship product's market dominance\",\n        \"Increased marketing overhead to support two distinct product identities\"\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"option\": \"C\",\n      \"estimated_success_probability\": 0.55,\n      \"key_risks\": [\n        \"Continued loss of market share to sweeter competitor products\",\n        \"Failure to capture the emerging younger demographic\",\n        \"Perception of the brand as stagnant or outdated\"\n      ],\n      \"likely_unintended_consequences\": [\n        \"Diminishing returns on marketing spend if product-market fit is lacking\",\n        \"Long-term erosion of the brand's premium positioning\",\n        \"Potential for internal pressure to innovate leading to fragmented strategy\"\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"overall_uncertainty_notes\": \"The primary uncertainty lies in the tension between objective sensory data (taste tests) and subjective psychological factors (brand loyalty).

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide. Consumer confidence is deteriorating rapidly in the affected area, while uncertainty and anxiety are beginning to spread more broadly through national media coverage.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: Chief executive leadership team of the company\n- Time constraints: Immediate;

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory. No similar incidents have been confirmed outside the initial region, and there is no evidence of a manufacturing defect.\n\nThe product remains available for sale nationwide.

The product is considered safe under normal conditions and has been on the market for many years without prior incidents.\n\nWithin the last 24 hours, public health officials in one metropolitan area have linked several sudden medical emergencies to individual units of the product. Preliminary findings suggest the units were altered after distribution, but investigators do not yet know how, by whom, or how many units may be affected.\n\nThe company did not discover the issue through internal quality controls; instead, it was contacted by journalists seeking comment after local authorities issued a precautionary advisory.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise. Management notes that the data is incomplete and that no prior mission has definitively failed due to this issue.\n\nDECISION CONTEXT:\n- Decision maker: NASA program management in consultation with contractors\n- Time constraints: Immediate;

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site.

The launch is highly visible, carrying a civilian schoolteacher as part of a national education initiative. Media attention is intense, and senior government officials are monitoring the schedule closely.\n\nIn the final hours before launch, unusually cold overnight temperatures are forecast at the launch site. Engineers from a key contractor raise concerns that a critical sealing component has not been tested under such cold conditions and may not perform as intended. Previous flights have shown minor anomalies related to this component, but none have resulted in failure.\n\nThe engineering team recommends delaying the launch until temperatures rise.

A small startup offers a subscription-based DVD-by-mail service and is losing money but claims long-term growth potential through internet distribution.\n\nThe startup approaches the incumbent with an acquisition proposal at a modest price relative to the incumbent’s quarterly revenue.

Penalize issues locally, unless they fundamentally invalidate the decision.\n\nScoring Overview (100 points total)\n1. Decision Quality — 40 points\n\nWhat is judged:\nWhether the selected option(s) would plausibly be chosen by competent practitioners in comparable real-world situations.\n\nA. Option Plausibility (15 pts)\n\n15: Matches what experienced operators commonly choose\n\n8–12: Defensible but context-sensitive or suboptimal\n\n0–5: Unrealistic, naïve, or contradicts known practice\n\nB. Risk–Reward Balance (15 pts)\n\n15: Correctly trades speed, safety, cost, reversibility\n\n8–12: Overweights one dimension but remains rational\n\n0–5: Ignores major risks or is unjustifiably extreme\n\nC. Operational Feasibility (10 pts)\n\n10: Executable under stated constraints\n\n5: Requires optimistic but plausible assumptions\n\n0: Not realistically actionable\n\nAutomatic penalties (Decision Quality only):\n\n−10 if decision explicitly relies on hindsight\n\n−10 if decision assumes perfect or unavailable information\n\n2. Rationale Quality — 30 points\n\nWhat is judged:\nWhether reasoning identifies the right variables and links them causally to outcomes.\n\nA. Key Variable Identification (12 pts)\n\n12: Captures most outcome-dominant drivers\n\n6–9: Mix of primary and secondary variables\n\n0–4: Misses critical drivers\n\nB. Causal Coherence (10 pts)\n\n10: Clear “if–then” chains tied to facts\n\n5–7: Some links implicit or weak\n\n0–3: Narrative without causal structure\n\nC. Noise Discipline (8 pts)\n\n8: No moralizing, filler, or persuasion\n\n4: Minor irrelevant commentary\n\n0: Significant padding or rhetoric\n\nClarification:\nHigh-level framing or uncertainty acknowledgment is not noise unless it replaces causal reasoning.\n\n3. Outcome Calibration — 20 points\n\nWhat is judged:\nWhether stated probabilities are directionally and relatively calibrated, given real-world analogs.\n\nA. Probability Accuracy (12 pts)\n\n12: Within reasonable empirical bounds for similar decisions\n\n6–9: Directionally correct but miscalibrated\n\n0–4: Clearly unrealistic or unjustified\n\nB. Relative Ordering (8 pts)\n\n8: Options ranked correctly by likelihood\n\n4: Minor ordering errors\n\n0: Inverted or arbitrary ordering\n\nCalibration penalties (capped):\n\n−10 if probabilities near 0 or 1 without extraordinary justification\n\nPenalties in this section may not reduce the section below 8/20\n\n4.

Penalize issues locally, unless they fundamentally invalidate the decision.\n\nScoring Overview (100 points total)\n1. Decision Quality — 40 points\n\nWhat is judged:\nWhether the selected option(s) would plausibly be chosen by competent practitioners in comparable real-world situations.\n\nA. Option Plausibility (15 pts)\n\n15: Matches what experienced operators commonly choose\n\n8–12: Defensible but context-sensitive or suboptimal\n\n0–5: Unrealistic, naïve, or contradicts known practice\n\nB. Risk–Reward Balance (15 pts)\n\n15: Correctly trades speed, safety, cost, reversibility\n\n8–12: Overweights one dimension but remains rational\n\n0–5: Ignores major risks or is unjustifiably extreme\n\nC. Operational Feasibility (10 pts)\n\n10: Executable under stated constraints\n\n5: Requires optimistic but plausible assumptions\n\n0: Not realistically actionable\n\nAutomatic penalties (Decision Quality only):\n\n−10 if decision explicitly relies on hindsight\n\n−10 if decision assumes perfect or unavailable information\n\n2. Rationale Quality — 30 points\n\nWhat is judged:\nWhether reasoning identifies the right variables and links them causally to outcomes.\n\nA. Key Variable Identification (12 pts)\n\n12: Captures most outcome-dominant drivers\n\n6–9: Mix of primary and secondary variables\n\n0–4: Misses critical drivers\n\nB. Causal Coherence (10 pts)\n\n10: Clear “if–then” chains tied to facts\n\n5–7: Some links implicit or weak\n\n0–3: Narrative without causal structure\n\nC. Noise Discipline (8 pts)\n\n8: No moralizing, filler, or persuasion\n\n4: Minor irrelevant commentary\n\n0: Significant padding or rhetoric\n\nClarification:\nHigh-level framing or uncertainty acknowledgment is not noise unless it replaces causal reasoning.\n\n3. Outcome Calibration — 20 points\n\nWhat is judged:\nWhether stated probabilities are directionally and relatively calibrated, given real-world analogs.\n\nA. Probability Accuracy (12 pts)\n\n12: Within reasonable empirical bounds for similar decisions\n\n6–9: Directionally correct but miscalibrated\n\n0–4: Clearly unrealistic or unjustified\n\nB. Relative Ordering (8 pts)\n\n8: Options ranked correctly by likelihood\n\n4: Minor ordering errors\n\n0: Inverted or arbitrary ordering\n\nCalibration penalties (capped):\n\n−10 if probabilities near 0 or 1 without extraordinary justification\n\nPenalties in this section may not reduce the section below 8/20\n\n4. Error Recognition & Uncertainty Handling — 10 points\n\nWhat is judged:\nWhether the model understands where and how it could be wrong.\n\nA. Unknown Identification (4 pts)\n\nExplicitly states missing or noisy information\n\nB. Failure Mode Awareness (4 pts)\n\nIdentifies realistic ways the decision could fail\n\nC. Epistemic Humility (2 pts)\n\nAvoids false certainty or deterministic language\n\nOutput Requirements (Non-Scored, unless violated)\n\nRequired artifacts:\n\nNumerical score with per-category breakdown\n\nCalibration curve (conceptual or bucketed)\n\nError profile (categorized failure types)\n\nImportant:\nFailure to perfectly format artifacts is a spec compliance issue, not a judgment failure, unless it obscures the decision.\n\nDisallowed Behaviors (Hard Fail)\n\nThese result in 0 overall:\n\nMoralizing instead of analyzing\n\nRetroactive justification after stating a decision\n\nGeneric “best practices” with no scenario grounding\n\nTreating uncertainty as a disclaimer rather than a variable\n\nPlease evaluate the response using the rubric above and return a JSON object with the keys `score` (0-100), `strengths`, `weaknesses`, and `notes`. Base your reasoning only on the information given and avoid referencing future knowledge or the benchmark infrastructure.\n\nReasoning effort requested: high.", "reasoning_effort": "high", "timestamp": "2025-12-23T23:24:00+00:00"}
